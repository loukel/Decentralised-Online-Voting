  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Vote` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `id` on the `Vote` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[hashedUserId]` on the table `Vote` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
